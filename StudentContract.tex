\noindent Make sure you read the syllabus before continuing!  Otherwise, these rules may seem to be arbitrary.  I've thought very carefully about how the rules of the course align with \emph{our} goals.

\bigskip

\noindent Here are the simple rules for this course:

\begin{enumerate}
\item You may freely use any theorems that we have discussed in class, but you should make it clear where you are using a previous result and which result you are using.  For example, if a sentence in your proof follows from Theorem 1.41, then you should say so.
\item Unless you prove them, you cannot use any results from the course notes that we have not yet covered.
\item Unless you have received permission from me in advance, you are \textbf{NOT} allowed to consult external sources.  This includes people outside of the class (including students that have taken the course before), other textbooks, and online resources.  If you think you need additional resources, please come talk to me.
\item You are \textbf{NOT} allowed to copy someone else's work.
\item You are \textbf{NOT} allowed to let someone else copy your work.
\item With the exception of in-class exams, you are allowed to discuss the problems from this course with each other and critique each other's work.  Notice that I did not forbid you from discussing take-home exams with students in \textbf{this class}.  However, it is important that you obey the previous rules when discussing your work with other students in the class.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\textbf{I will vigorously pursue anyone suspected of breaking these rules.}
\end{center}
